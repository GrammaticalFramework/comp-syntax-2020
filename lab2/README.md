# Lab 2: Multilingual generation and translation

This lab corresponds to Chapters 5 to 9 of the Notes, but follows them only loosely.
Therefore we will structure it according to the exercise sessions
rather than chapters.
The abstract syntax is given in the subdirectory grammars/abstract/

## Session 5

1. Design a morphology for the main lexical types (N, A, V) with parameters and a couple of paradigms.
2. Test it by implementing the lexicon in the MicroLang module. You need to define lincat N,A,V,V2 as well as the paradigms in MicroResource.

## Session 6

1. Define the linearization types of main phrasal categories - the remaining categories in MicroLang.
2. Define the rest of the linearization rules in MicroLang.

## Session 7

1. Complete the rest of the definitions of RGL categories and functions in MiniGrammar.
2. Add concrete UD labels.
3. Generate a synthetic UD treebank.


## Session 8

1. Implement a simple application grammar, application/Doctor.gf.
This can be be done either by using your own MiniResource or the standard resource.
There are two versions of English implementation to support this.
Your first approximation can be just to copy it and change the words.
